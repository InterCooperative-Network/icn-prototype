# Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The **InterCooperative Network (ICN)** is designed as a decentralized platform that enables cooperative management, democratic governance, and secure resource sharing. It incorporates blockchain technology, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and a unique consensus mechanism called **Proof of Cooperation (PoC)**.

## Core Components

### 1. Blockchain Layer
The blockchain serves as the foundation for the ICN, enabling secure and tamper-proof transactions. It is responsible for:
- **Block Creation & Validation**: Blocks are created based on cooperative actions and validated through the PoC mechanism.
- **Transaction Management**: Transactions represent various actions within the network, including cooperative activities, DID registration, and resource exchanges.
- **Sharding**: The blockchain is designed to support sharding, allowing for efficient processing and scaling by dividing the network into smaller segments called shards.

### 2. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
DIDs ensure privacy-preserving identity management in the ICN. Key aspects include:
- **User Registration**: Users create a base DID, which remains private.
- **Cooperative-Specific DIDs**: To interact with specific cooperatives, users generate secondary DIDs that protect the anonymity of their base DID.
- **Secure Metadata Exchange**: DIDs facilitate secure interactions among nodes, cooperatives, and users.

### 3. Proof of Cooperation (PoC) Consensus
The PoC consensus mechanism differs from traditional Proof of Work or Proof of Stake systems. Key features include:
- **Cooperative Reputation**: Nodes represent cooperatives, and their validation power is based on the cooperative's reputation within the network.
- **Gas-Free Transactions**: Transactions do not require gas fees, making the network more accessible and cost-effective.
- **Node Rotation**: After validating a block, nodes enter a cooldown period, preventing monopolization and ensuring fair participation.

### 4. API Layer
The API layer enables interaction with the ICN from external applications and services. It supports:
- **Public Endpoints**: For basic network information, cooperative listings, and DID lookups.
- **Private Endpoints**: For user registration, transaction submission, and cooperative management.

### 5. Testing Framework
ICN includes a comprehensive testing framework to ensure the system’s reliability and performance:
- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual components like transaction handlers and block validators.
- **Integration Tests**: Check interactions among modules, ensuring consistent behavior across components.
- **Performance Tests**: Measure the network’s scalability and stress resilience, especially in sharded environments.

## System Workflow
1. **User Registration**: A user creates a base DID and cooperative-specific DIDs for interactions.
2. **Transaction Creation**: Users perform actions, such as voting, resource sharing, or registration, which generate transactions.
3. **Block Validation**: Transactions are grouped into blocks, validated by nodes based on cooperative reputation.
4. **State Update**: Shards update their state based on the validated block, ensuring consistency across the network.

## Future Enhancements
Planned improvements to the ICN architecture include:
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Allowing ICN to interact with other blockchain networks.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enhancing privacy by using cryptographic proofs to verify transactions without revealing sensitive information.
- **Layer-2 Scaling**: Implementing off-chain solutions to further improve transaction throughput and efficiency.
